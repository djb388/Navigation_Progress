/**
 * Map data represented as two 2D arrays of longs.
 * 
 * - Two 2D arrays are used to facilitate bit-manipulation along both the X-axis
 *   and the Y-axis.
 * 
 * - Assumes a maximum grid size of 128x128.
 * 
 * - The set bits in each long represent non-walkable squares in a grid.
 * 
 * - "Real coords" refers to the actual grid's coordinates.
 * - "Map coords" refers to the real coords mapped to a normalized 128x128 grid.
 * - "Indices" or "index" typically refers to indices of bits in the long arrays.
 * 
 * - "Origin" refers to a reference point used to convert between map coords and 
 *    real coords, enabling the user of the map to gather data of a grid up to 
 *    128x128 without knowing the real dimensions.
 * 
 *    Origin in real coords - parameter required by the constructor.
 *    Origin in map coords  - (128,128)
 *    Origin rowMajor index - [128][4]
 *    Origin colMajor index - [4][128]
